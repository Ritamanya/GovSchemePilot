# GovSchemePilot: AI-Powered Citizen Empowerment 🚀

**An initiative by HyperFlux AI for the AI for Bharat Hackathon 2026.**

GovSchemePilot is an autonomous, voice-activated agentic system designed to bridge the digital and linguistic divide for rural Indian citizens. It empowers users to discover eligible government schemes and automates the complex application process through conversational AI and multimodal vision.

## 🌟 Vision & Impact
Millions of eligible citizens in rural India miss out on life-changing welfare benefits due to digital illiteracy, language barriers, and the complexity of government portals. **GovSchemePilot** replaces confusing web navigation with a simple, voice-first conversation in **Bengali** and **Hindi**, ensuring that every citizen has a "Digital Pilot" to guide them to their rightful benefits.

## ✨ Key Features
* **Multilingual Voice Interface:** Direct interaction in regional dialects (Bengali/Hindi) using **Amazon Transcribe** and **Polly**.
* **Agentic Scheme Discovery:** Intelligent matching of user profiles to 5,000+ government schemes using **Amazon Bedrock (Claude 3.5 Sonnet)**.
* **Vision-Based Navigation:** A revolutionary "self-healing" engine that "sees" form fields via multimodal AI, ensuring compatibility even if portal layouts change.
* **Human-in-the-Loop Security:** Mandatory voice-verification and data review stages to ensure accuracy and user consent.
* **Zero-Learning Curve:** Designed specifically for first-time internet users with high-contrast, icon-driven interfaces.

## 🏗️ Technical Architecture
The system is built on a modular, serverless architecture for maximum scalability and cost-efficiency:

* **Intelligence:** Amazon Bedrock (Claude 3.5 Sonnet)
* **Automation:** Python, Playwright
* **Voice Processing:** Amazon Transcribe, Amazon Polly, Indic-TTS
* **Backend:** Python (Flask/FastAPI), AWS Lambda
* **Frontend:** Accessible HTML5/CSS3/JS Mobile-First Interface

## 📁 Repository Structure
* `requirements.md`: Detailed functional and non-functional requirements.
* `design.md`: Technical architecture, system components, and Mermaid diagrams.
* `README.md`: This project overview.

## 🚀 Future Roadmap (As it now an idea I will make it functional soon!)
* **Phase 1 (MVP):** Bengali/Hindi support for high-priority central and state schemes.
* **Phase 2 (Scaling):** Expansion to 10+ regional languages and integration with 500+ portals.
* **Phase 3 (Optimization):** Launch of the "Vision Navigator" public API for broader developer use.
